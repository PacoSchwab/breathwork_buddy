# Breathwork Buddy - Capstone Project @ neuefische Bootcamp

Welcome to Breathwork Buddy, an app thats provides you with all the tools you need to practice three different breathing exercises. 
## Description

The buddy leads you through the breath flows and lets you track your retention times as well as the time you stay in cold water such as ice baths, which could be an additional (but not necessary) part of your breathing routine to improve your health, lower your stress level and train your immune system. After completing a session you will be rewarded with a mindfulness quote of the day. You find detailed instructions and basic information of the exercises on the info page. Practicing the different exercises on a daily base could be a real game changer in your life and this app is all you need to get started! It is for free, but if you like my work you can support me on my journey by donating me a virtual coffee (find the button on the „info“ page inside the app. By the way, the app works fine on desktops but is optimized for usage on mobile devices.
